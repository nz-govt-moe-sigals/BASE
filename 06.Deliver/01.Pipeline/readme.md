Why the subfolders under 01.system?

A simple solution may be developed from a single deployed system (eg: the MAIN website).

A more complex solution may be developed by deploying more than one system (microservices, secondary websites other than the MAIN system, etc).

Hence the folders 01.MAIN, 02.NEXTSYSTEM, etc.
