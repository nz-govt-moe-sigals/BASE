# About #

New Team Member. Woohoo. Now what?

The code is:
* in a Git Repository
* to which access is managed by Visual Studio
* relying on an integration with either:
  * An Organisation Azure Active Directory
  * A set of Microsoft Account (personal) accounts.
The repository contains:
* C# .NET code, assembled as a Visual Studio manged solution
* Powershell, developed using Visual Studio Code, configured for Powershell.

Prerequisites:
  * Tools: 
    * Developers will need:
      * Visual Studio:
      * to develop the project (Logic Application as Code)
    * Resharper:
      * Resharper is absolutely required. Not because it enforces code styling (which is not bad)
        but because it adds to Visual Studio the ability to F12 to the Implementation of Interfaces.
    * Visual Studio Code:
      * To develop ARM templates (Infrastructure Services as Code)
	  * To work with Powershell scripts (Deployment as Code)
  * Subscriptions:
    * MSDN
  * Access:
    * Access to the Visual Studio Code.
