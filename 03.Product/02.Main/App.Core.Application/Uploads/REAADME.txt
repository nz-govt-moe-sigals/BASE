Uploading Files to a server is such a BAD idea that I'm 
going to immediately regret giving anyone assistance with
doing it... But here's an Upload folder to save files to
when developing on a local machine and you can't access the
net to use a storage account (ie, you're living under a rock)

Why is it bad? Bar the obvious malware implications, there's 
the simple fact that Azure periodically needs to cycle apps
and does not guarantee on what machine your app is restarted on,
so any files you saved to the hard-drive are no longer accessible
as they are on someone elses new machine...

Basically it's both a source of bugs and security issues. Don't do it.
Even if this folder has been provided...
