## About ##

What you're probably looking for (code) is under Deliverables/Code. But you really must start with Environment, then DeliveryPipeline...



### Instructions ###

Review your target environment parameters, build a delivery pipeline that references these, as well as the core deliverable code.

Use work on the primary deliverable code -- but only after doing the above first :-)
